## Resources I'm using to learn programming language design

I'm an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science. I fell in love with programming language design after a Automata Theory and Compiler Construction course. This repo will be a collection of resources for my exploration & learning about the fields.

If you find this repo helpful, your ðŸŒŸ is the best gift for me :)

## Overview

This repo may little bit long and may grow as I learn. Here are the section links. After each section, there will be a â†© which can link you back into Overview.

## Courses

### Compilers

[Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: Nand to Tetris Part II (project-centered course)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2)

In this project-centered course you will build a modern software hierarchy, designed to enable the translation and execution of object-based, high-level languages on a bare-bone computer hardware platform. In particular, you will implement a virtual machine and a compiler for a simple, Java-like programming language, and you will develop a basic operating system that closes gaps between the high-level language and the underlying hardware platform.

[ Compilers By Stanford SOE-YCSCS1 ](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/soe-ycscs1-compilers)

This self-paced course will discuss the major ideas used today in the implementation of programming language compilers, including lexical analysis, parsing, syntax-directed translation, abstract syntax trees, types and type checking, intermediate languages, dataflow analysis, program optimization, code generation, and runtime systems.
